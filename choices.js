He however, can see it because he has the power to be able to see maps which are blank to everyone else. He finds a route to Miami Fl. And at the top of the map he sees a familiar figure that looks like a trident ðŸ”±. He then makes a sketch of that map since he canâ€™t take the one from the Museum. This map has coordinates which leads to an unknown location in Miami. ",
